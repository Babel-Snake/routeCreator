Hereâ€™s the generated service file for handling mentor-related operations, based on the provided routes, controller, and schema. This service will implement the necessary methods to handle the registration of mentors, including database interactions, error handling, and logging.

```javascript
/**
 * mentorService.js
 * 
 * This file contains the service logic for mentor-related operations.
 * It includes functions to create mentor users and handle related business logic.
 * This service interacts with the database for storing mentor information.
 */

const { Mentor, sequelize } = require('../models'); // Importing Mentor model and sequelize for transactions
const logger = require('../utils/logging/logger'); // Custom logger for logging events and errors
const AppError = require('../utils/errors/errorUtils'); // Custom error class for handling application errors
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt'); // For password hashing
const saltRounds = 10;

/**
 * Create a new mentor user.
 * 
 * This function handles the registration process for new mentors.
 * It hashes the mentor's password and stores their details in the database.
 * 
 * @param {string} email - The email address of the new mentor.
 * @param {string} password - The password for the new mentor.
 * @param {string} name - The name of the new mentor.
 * @returns {object} - An object containing the mentor details.
 * @throws {AppError} - Throws an error if any step in the process fails.

const createMentor = async (email, password, name) => {
    // Start a transaction to ensure atomicity
    const transaction = await sequelize.transaction();
    try {
        // Hash the password
        const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);

        // Create a new mentor record
        const mentor = await Mentor.create({
            email,
            password: hashedPassword,
            name,
            role: 'mentor', // Assuming mentors have a role field
        }, { transaction });

        await transaction.commit();

        logger.info(`Mentor created successfully: ${email}`);

        await transaction.rollback();
        logger.error('Error creating mentor:', {
            message: error.message,
            stack: error.stack,

### Explanation:
1. **File Header**: The header provides a brief description of the file's purpose.
2. **Imports**: Necessary modules are imported, including the Mentor model, logger, custom error handling, and bcrypt for password hashing.
3. **`createMentor` Method**:
   - **Transaction Handling**: A transaction is initiated to ensure that the creation of the mentor is atomic; if any part fails, all changes are rolled back.
   - **Password Hashing**: The mentor's password is hashed before being stored in the database for security.
   - **Database Operation**: A new mentor record is created in the Mentor table with the provided email, hashed password, and name.
   - **Logging**: Successful creation and any errors are logged for tracking.
   - **Error Handling**: An error is thrown if any part of the process fails, which is caught in the controller for appropriate response handling.
4. **Exporting the Service**: The `createMentor` function is exported for use in the controller.

This service file adheres to best practices for service layer design, ensuring proper error handling, logging, and database interactions based on the provided schema.
